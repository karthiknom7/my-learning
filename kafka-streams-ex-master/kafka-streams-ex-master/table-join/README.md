# Table-Table Join

***Currently this example will not work.
It's built against a snapshot version of Kafka due to a bug, so the API is incompatible with 0.10.0.0 and will not compile.***

I'll update the docs for this one when 0.10.1.0 is released, which should contain the bug fix and the API changes.
